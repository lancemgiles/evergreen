features to add:


double jump powerup?
another move (dash?)?
max lives increase
larger creature taming mini-game? puzzle to get to an item the creature wants (Cedar can't sooth anything while carrying something, and the item is lost if he is hurt and drops it - nonessential for progression but a cool side thing to do - like to unlock a moving platform shortcut)?
traps (falling platforms, areas that cannot be moved through easily, slick areas, sticky areas)
