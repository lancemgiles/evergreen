quick facts: jump height is 9 tiles (8x8) or 3.5 (16x16)
step distance is about 16~24px


features to add:


double jump powerup?
another move (dash?)?
max lives increase
larger creature taming mini-game? puzzle to get to an item the creature wants (Cedar can't sooth anything while carrying something, and the item is lost if he is hurt and drops it - nonessential for progression but a cool side thing to do - like to unlock a moving platform shortcut)?
traps (falling platforms, areas that cannot be moved through easily, slick areas, sticky areas)


current bugs and issues:

it works but player script is getting very long, might be worth splitting states into different scripts. it is very confusing when something goes wrong.

animation player is semisetup
