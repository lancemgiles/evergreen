features to add:
drop down from one-way platforms? (to drop down, make a scene with a static body with a collision shape set to one-way, and make a function to drop down position.y (ray cast to check the platform is a one-way))
turn moving platforms into creatures that must be soothed to ride
double jump powerup?
another move (dash?)?
max lives increase
larger creature taming mini-game? puzzle to get to an item the creature wants (Cedar can't sooth anything while carrying something, and the item is lost if he is hurt and drops it - nonessential for progression but a cool side thing to do - like to unlock a moving platform shortcut)?
different kinds of enemies (since they will share a lot, maybe a state machine is the best way to handle them)
traps (falling platforms, areas that cannot be moved through easily, slick areas, sticky areas)
